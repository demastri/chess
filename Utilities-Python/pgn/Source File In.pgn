{This game was three weeks ago and I'm still salty about it. At the end of the day, it's MY fault to not finish a game off. There is absolutely NO excuse to lose a game of chess on time. This is the definitive "think long, think wrong" game. You're a piece up. Play simple. This is two games in a row where I was much better against Mishra, and could not finish. What feeble analysis there is is mine, anything SF found in blunder check is marked (SF) - I'm sure there will be plenty.} 1. a4 {[%emt 1:40:00]} d5 {[%emt 1:40:00]} 2. d3 {[%emt 1:40:00]} Nf6 {[%emt 1:39:56]} 3.
